In order to put together the Home Service Robot, I made use of the turtlebot packages: turtlebot_teleop to move the turtlebot in the Gazeo environment, turtlebot_rviz_lauchers to be able to interface it with the ROS Navigation stack and view it in Rviz, and the turtlebot_gazebo package to spawn the turtlebot in my gazebo world. In addition to these, I used the gmapping package to implement SLAM algorithms and create a map of my gazebo world.
